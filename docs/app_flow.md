# App Flow Outline: The "b." Ritual

This document outlines the user journey from opening the app to the "Done" state, adhering to the "Slow Down Intentionally" principle.

## 1. The Opening (The Breath)
- **Trigger**: User opens the app.
- **Visual**: A blank, soft-colored screen that slowly fades in.
- **Interaction**: No immediate inputs. A subtle breathing animation (expand/contract) guides the user to take one breath before proceeding.
- **Micro-copy**: "Just be. For a moment."

## 2. The Daily Pulse (Check-in)
- **Goal**: Assess current energy state to tailor content.
- **UI**: Minimalist slider or 3-point selector.
- **Question**: "Where is your energy right now?"
- **Input**:
    - Axis 1: Anxious <-> Calm
    - Axis 2: Scattered <-> Focused
    - Axis 3: Drained <-> Energized
- **Transition**: Smooth fade out upon selection. No "Submit" button; selection triggers the next state.

## 3. The Insight (Journaling)
- **Goal**: Brief reflection to build the Psychographic Profile.
- **UI**: Single card with a question.
- **Content**: One reflective question selected by AI (e.g., "What is one thing you are dreading?").
- **Input**: Text area (limited character count to encourage brevity, or unlimited for "The Sponge" types).
- **Action**: User types answer -> "Release" button (instead of "Save").

## 4. The "b. Brief" (News Refiner)
- **Goal**: Inform without overwhelming.
- **Logic**:
    - If Pulse = Anxious: Show 3 "Solution-focused" headlines. Soft tone.
    - If Pulse = Resilient: Show 5 "Direct" headlines. Neutral tone.
- **UI**: Horizontal scroll (carousel) or simple list. One item at a time.
- **Constraint**: Maximum 5 items.
- **Interaction**: Swipe to dismiss or tap to expand (brief summary only, no infinite read).

## 5. The "Done" State (The Horizon)
- **Goal**: Signal the end of the session. Prevent doomscrolling.
- **Trigger**: User finishes the "b. Brief" or completes the Insight.
- **Visual**: A high-quality, full-screen landscape image (nature, abstract calm).
- **Micro-copy**: "You are done. Go be."
- **Action**:
    - "Close App" button (prominent).
    - "Explore b. Local" (secondary, subtle).
    - "Comfort Tracker" (secondary, subtle).

## Optional Flows (Post-Done)

### b. Local (Event Finder)
- **Access**: From "Done" state.
- **UI**: Map or List of "Nourishing" events.
- **Filter**: AI removes competitive events.
- **Detail**: "3 b. members are going."

### Comfort Tracker
- **Access**: From "Done" state.
- **UI**: Simple timer or log.
- **Action**: "I sat for 15 mins." -> Visual reward (e.g., a flower blooms).
