# UI/UX Directive: The "b." Aesthetic

## Core Philosophy: "Slow Down Intentionally"
Every pixel must serve the purpose of reducing cognitive load. The interface should feel like a deep breath.

## 1. Color Palette (The Sanctuary)
Avoid high-contrast pure blacks or whites. Use "off" colors that mimic natural materials.

### Primary Colors
- **b. Sand**: `#F5F2EB` (Background - Warm, paper-like)
- **b. Charcoal**: `#2D2D2D` (Text - Softer than black)
- **b. Sage**: `#8DA399` (Primary Action - Calming green)

### Secondary Colors (The Elements)
- **Clay**: `#D4A59A` (Warmth/Comfort)
- **Mist**: `#E0E6E6` (Secondary Backgrounds)
- **Night**: `#1A1A1A` (Dark Mode Background - Deep, not void)

## 2. Typography (The Voice)
Typography should be readable, humanist, and airy.

### Font Family
- **Primary (Headings)**: *Outfit* or *DM Sans* (Geometric but friendly).
- **Secondary (Body)**: *Inter* or *Lora* (High legibility).

### Typesetting Rules
- **Line Height**: Generous (1.6 - 1.8).
- **Whitespace**: Extreme. 50% of the screen should often be negative space.
- **Hierarchy**: Use size and weight sparingly. Avoid "shouting" with all-caps.

## 3. Spacing & Layout (The Pacing)
- **Margins**: Wide. Content should never touch the edges.
- **Cards**: Soft borders (1px solid `#E5E5E5`), large border-radius (24px).
- **Shadows**: Diffused, ambient shadows only. No sharp drop shadows.

## 4. Interaction Design (The Feel)
- **Micro-interactions**: Slow, fluid transitions (e.g., 500ms duration).
- **Feedback**: Haptic feedback on mobile for "grounding" actions (e.g., selecting a pulse).
- **Scroll**: No infinite scroll. Content is paginated or finite lists.

## 5. Imagery (The Anchor)
- **Style**: Abstract nature, macro photography, soft focus.
- **Subject**: Textures (stone, water, leaf, fabric).
- **Avoid**: People faces (triggers social comparison), busy cityscapes.

## 6. Dark Mode (The Cave)
- **Trigger**: Automatic based on time of day or user preference.
- **Palette**: Deep charcoal backgrounds, muted text. Reduced blue light emission.
